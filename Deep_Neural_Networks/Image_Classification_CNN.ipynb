    "For our practical session, we are going to inplement on of the most common computer vision tasks- image classification. We will use the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used collection of 60,000 small, 32x32 color images divided into 10 distinct object classes (like airplanes, cats, cars, dogs, ships, trucks) for training and testing computer vision models, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing, serving as a benchmark for algorithm performance in machine learning. \n",

    "For this task we will need to also install a new librarry called keras.So go ahead and run \n",
    "```pip install --upgrade keras``` on your terminal.\n"
