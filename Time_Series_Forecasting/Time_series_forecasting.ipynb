    "A time series is a sequence of data points collected, recorded, or measured at successive, evenly-spaced time intervals. Each data point represents observations or measurements taken over time, such as stock prices, temperature readings, or sales figures. Time series data is commonly represented graphically with time on the horizontal axis and the variable of interest on the vertical axis, allowing analysts to identify trends, patterns, and changes over time.\n",

    "**Time-series Forecasting** is the process of using historical data to predict future values in a sequence measured over time. It analyzes past trends, patterns, and seasonality to estimate upcoming outcomes—such as sales, weather, or stock prices."
